**Version Control Functionality**  
This program asks for your name and birthday and then:  
    1.) Calculates your age  
    2.) Calculates the number of days until your next birthday (starting today)  
    3.) Wishes you a happy birthday if today is your birthday  
    4.) Calculates your Chinese zodiac (based on your birth year)  

**How to use:**  
Running through JupyterHub:  
    1.) Log into your JupyterHub account  
    2.) Open a new terminal  
    3.) Clone repository with command `git clone https://github.com/annaloggg/VERSION-CONTROL-PLZ-WORK.git`  
    4.) Run VersionControlFinal.ipynb  
    5.) Follow the prompts and you are good to go !! :))  

**How to contribute:**  
So you wanna help us out with this *awesome* piece of code, huh?  
That's actually very sweet thank you (because spoiler alert: you will sadly *not* be getting paid)  
That being said, here are the instructions to follow if you really wanna contribute:  
    1.) Follow the instructions for how to make a fork that Github provides here: [Github Forks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)  
    2.) Once you have created your fork, you can edit the files in JupyterNotebook  
    3.) Anytime you want to update the repository on Github you need to follow 3 steps *in order*:  
            - ADD     --> `git add <filename.extension>`  
            - COMMIT  --> `git commit -m "your message here"`  
            - PUSH    --> `git push`(this actually makes the changes to Github)  
    4.) This will push your changes to your branch of the repository  
    5.) You must then make a pull request to merge your changes to the main branch! Here is the Github page on pull requests: [Github Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
    
    6.) Please Read the CODE-OF-CONDUCT, [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md) and THANKS FOR CONTRIBUTING!
